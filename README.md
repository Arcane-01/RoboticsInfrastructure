# RoboticsInfrastructure

Robots and tools useful for us and not included in the official ROS or Gazebo packages.

## How to contribute.

**First of all** you have to know the infrastructure where you will develop your code: 

- Gazebo version,
- ROS version
- Python version (if you develop in Python).

This repository is divided into **four branches**. **Depending on the version** of the mentioned software you will have to move to one of them to have the version compatible with your software. The branches are:
- `melodic-devel` (default branch)
- [`noetic-devel`](https://github.com/JdeRobot/CustomRobots/tree/noetic-devel)
- [`foxy-devel`](https://github.com/JdeRobot/CustomRobots/tree/foxy-devel)
- [`humble-devel`](https://github.com/JdeRobot/CustomRobots/tree/humble-devel)
